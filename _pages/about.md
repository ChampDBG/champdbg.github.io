## Bio
I am a research engineer at DENSO's [Pittsburgh Innovation Lab](https://www.denso.com/us-ca/en/business/pittsburghlab/), where I currently research autonomous driving question as a visiting researcher with [Auton Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/auton-lab/), advised by Jeff Schneider.

Before that, I worked in DENSO's [Global R&D Tokyo](https://www.denso.com/jp/ja/news/newsroom/2020/20200706-01/), where I developed DNN-based algorithm for advanced driver assistance systems. This technology can forecast the lane-changing and cut-in intentions of surrounding vehicles early. It has already passed proof-of-concept (PoC) and been transferred to a product team. 

## Research Interests
I'm interested in the intesection of machine learning and motion planning. These include reinforcement learning, uncertainty quantification, and safety control.

My MS theses designed new updating strategy to improve deep reinforcement learning and demostrated the applicability of my method by applying in [quadcopter navitation system](/publication/wu2018navigating) and server loading balance of [distributing network traffic](/publication/lai2020cognitive).
