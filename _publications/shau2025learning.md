## Abstract

Autonomous driving promises safer and more efficient transportation, yet level 5 autonomy remains out of reach due to the unpredictability of human road users. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for developing driving policies in simulators, but progress is hindered by the difficulty of handling diverse multi-agent interactions. In the case of autonomous driving specifically, solving specific scenarios requires careful reasoning about the environment, rendering learning through vanilla reinforcement learning methods time-consuming or even impossible. To mitigate this, in this work, we present an LLM-guided reward shaping algorithm for autonomous driving. To contend with the very large set of driving scenarios available, we focus exclusively on failure cases when generating LLM-based improvements. Our approach distills the improved behavior naturally into the global policy. Our approach consistently outperforms other approaches on a generative model-based simulator.
